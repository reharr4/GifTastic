# GifTastic
Week 6, Homework

Used the JS to dynamically add gifs from the Giphy API to search for and watch themed gifs.
https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=&api_key=vVUVgEidbLRXqZbFQj3rwYnqtSXxw0MN&limit=10"

Used on.("click") function to pause and unpause gifs

If the user does not want to view the artist gifs I have provided, they can add their own through the text input at the bottom of the page.
